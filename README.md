Java Solutions for CodeWars
===========================

Each solution has its own separate branch.  The idea behind this is that I don't have to maintain old solutions 
in case the the starting template (master branch) gets updated.

The solutions are in various states.  Sometimes I try to make production quality code.  Other times I'll try 
some creative solution.  But most likely I'll just find a quick and dirty solution to the issue.  So don't judge 
me to hard on this stuff.  After all it's just for my fun and not an interview / showcase of my skills.
