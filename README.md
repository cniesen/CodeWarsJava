Java Solutions for CodeWars
===========================

Each solution has its own separate branch.  The idea behind this is that I don't have to maintain old solutions 
in case the the starting template (master branch) gets updated.

The solutions are in various states.  Sometimes I try to make production quality code.  Other times I'll try 
some creative solution.  But most likely I'll just find a quick and dirty solution to the issue.  So don't judge 
me to hard on this stuff.  After all it's just for my fun and not an interview / showcase of my skills.

Odd March Bits 8 bits
---------------------

I wasted some time trying to use bitwise operators to solve the issue.  The truth is that I never really had a 
need to use bitwise operators for my day job.  However, I did encounter production code that used bit representation
and operation in order to improve performance unnecessarily while making the code hard to understand and maintain.

Finally I just decided to do it as simple and clear as possible.  So nothing fancy here but at least fairly easy to
follow.
